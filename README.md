<h1>Using node.js with express<h1>
  <h2> What we learnt:<h2>
    <ul>
  <li>Using .gitignore is very important when using modules, to avoid pushing all module files onto github.</li>
      <li>We used nodemon as a developer tool so that we didn't need to keep disconnecting and reconnecting to the server to see our changes.</li>
  <li>If you pull down somebody else's repo with a package.json file you should run npm i in order to install all of the dependencies which will allow the code to run correctly.</li>
   <li>We looked at using common JS to export data stored in one .js file by using module.exports and importing it into another file by using require.</li>
     <li>We used dot notation to access the information stored within the file.</li>
   <li>We used app.get('/', (req, res) => in order to handle get requests and use a function to tell the server what to return.</li>
   <li>We used res.json() to return objects through the local server.</li>
     <li>We used app.listen(port, () => to tell the server which local port to listen for get requests on.</li>
      <li>We stored our port number in a variable for ease of changing later on.</li>
 
 </ul>
                 
<p>After class I revisited these concepts to consolodate my knowledge and improve my understanding. The files attached are my practice files.</p>
